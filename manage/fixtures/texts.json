  "I had always been a collector. I collected baseball cards as a little kid, and then when I was about eight I started collecting comic books. Then I started getting into hip-hop in about 1982, you know, on the radio, listening to “The Message” and going to the store with my allowance and buying 12\\\" and the few albums that existed then.\\n\\nFrom the moment I started buying vinyl, I was a collector. I mean, the first 70 records I owned, I’d put a little sticker on them denoting the chronology of when I bought them. The first album I bought was Street Beats Vol. 2, which was a Sugar Hill Records compilation, and I bought it because it was good value.\\n\\nAnyone who was into that culture kinda gravitated towards one another, and in my school there was perhaps only a dozen or so that were really into it. I remember this one kid who used to go to Sacramento quite a lot, which was the nearest major city to where I lived. He had access to some records that we weren’t able to find locally and when he decided to sell his collection I bought all his stuff, so I was always out there finding [records].\\n\\nHerman Kelly - Dance To The Drummer’s Beat\\nThen I started buying older stuff around ’87, because I started being obsessed about sampling and the samples that people were using and what they were; from my dad’s record collection I was able to start spotting certain samples. He had some Isaac Hayes records and some other jazz stuff like Clifford Coulter, jazz artists with semi-funky cuts on them.\\n\\nI remember the first time I went to a store with the intent of looking for breaks and samples, which was about 1987, and I bought The Payback by James Brown, the second Soul Searchers album and “Dance To The Drummer’s Beat” by Herman Kelly. At that time that stuff was plentiful and cheap and nobody cared. At least not where I was, and that really was the case for another eight or nine years.\\n\\nI didn’t get into 45s until about late 1989. It was my senior year in high school. The impetus for that was this cat who was staying in town, which was a college town, and he was the first guy I knew who had an SP-1200. He was from New York and he claimed to have some sort of ties to the Bomb Squad, Public Enemy’s production company.\\n\\nHe had a big stack of 45s and I was looking through going, “What’s the point of these?” I always thought 45s were just shorter versions of things you could find on albums or 12\\\"s. He said, “No, no, man, 45s are where it’s at.” He proceeded to play me some and I remember General Crook’s “Gimme Some” was one of them. I remember staring at the label.",
  "Abbey Lincoln started her career in the early 1950s as a supper club singer. With the encouragement of club owners and her manager, Lincoln cultivated a very seductive image, wearing tight, revealing gowns and singing romantic ballads.\\n\\nLincoln's self image started to change in the late 50s when she met jazz drummer Max Roach, who introduced her to modern jazz and to a performing style influenced by the new black consciousness. They got married, and in the years they stayed together, they recorded a series of albums. Instead of pop arrangements, Lincoln was backed by great jazz performers. Her songs took on a political edge, and she became active in the freedom movement.\\n\\nIn the 1960s, Lincoln also had an acting career. She co-starred in the acclaimed independent film drama Nothing but a Man about a young black couple in the south. She also co-starred opposite Sidney Poitier in the romantic comedy For Love of Ivy.\\n\\nIn 1974, after a ten year hiatus from recording, she went to Africa, where she was given the name Aminata by the President of Guinea and the name Moseka by Zaire's Minister of Information. Today she uses the name Aminata Moseka alongside Abbey Lincoln to represent her African heritage.\\n\\nClick the \\\"Listen Now\\\" link above to hear Abbey Lincoln talk more about her life and career."
